Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects communication, social interaction, and behavior. One of the common challenges faced by parents of children with ASD is establishing and maintaining a strong bond with their child. Children with ASD may have difficulties with social communication, emotional regulation, and sensory sensitivities, which can impact their ability to form and maintain close relationships with their parents. This can result in strained parent-child relationships, reduced emotional connection, and challenges in meeting the child's developmental, emotional, and behavioral needs. Strengthening the bond between child and parent is crucial to promote positive developmental outcomes and improve the well-being of both the child and the parent in the context of ASD.

Our project for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) focuses on providing a range of services to support parents in strengthening their bond with their child with ASD. These services include:

Fun Games for ASD: These games are carefully designed to promote communication, social skills, and emotional regulation in a playful and enjoyable manner. By incorporating elements such as visual supports, clear instructions, and individualized adaptations, our games are tailored to the unique needs and interests of children with ASD

Text-to-Speech Technology: this allows children with limited verbal communication abilities to express themselves, share their thoughts, and engage in conversations with their parents.

Parent Education and Training: We offer comprehensive parent education and training programs that provide parents with knowledge, skills, and strategies to better understand and support their child with ASD.

Scheduler : Parents can plan the days for child, log their medicine records.
