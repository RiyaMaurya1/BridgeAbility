                    <p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a range of brain disorders that are characterized by restricted patterns of behavior and impairments in social communication and interactions. These disorders share common origins and features, but are classified as spectrum disorders because symptoms and severity vary among individuals.</p>

                What are the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders?
                <span class="faq-plus">&plus;</span>
              </h4>
              <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Symptoms/behaviors of ASDs can range from mild to severe, and may seem to appear gradually or suddenly. Atypical development may be observed from birth, or more commonly, become noticeable during the 12- to 36-month period.
                <br>
            Symptoms include:
            <br>
            <br>
            Social Deficits - Children with autism have difficulty in social interactions. They may avoid eye contact and interactions with people and resist or passively accept attention. They are often unable to read social cues or exhibit emotional reciprocity. Thus, they are unable to predict or understand other peoples’ behavior. 
            They may also have difficulty controlling emotion, may be disruptive or aggressive at times, or may lose control, especially when frustrated or presented with a new situation or environment. Head-banging, hair-pulling and arm-biting may occur.
            <br>
            <br>
            Communication Difficulties - Communication skills are affected in children with autism, but difficulties vary. Some children may have good basic language skills, but exhibit difficulty initiating or sustaining conversations, such as not giving others the opportunity to respond. 
            Others may experience delays or regression in language development; still others remain mute or may use language in unusual ways, such as repeating a phrase, or parroting what they hear (echolalia). Body language is also often hard to read in children with autism. 
            Facial expressions, tone of voice and gestures often do not match verbal content and emotions. They have difficulty expressing what they want or need. They may also appear deaf, not responding to their names or attempts at conversation.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Repetitive Behaviors - Patterns of behavior, interests and activities may be restricted, repetitive or stereotyped. For example, a child may spend long periods of time arranging specific toys in a particular manner, rather than playing with the toys. 
            Intense preoccupation with certain topics, such as obsessively studying maps, may also be seen. Odd repetitive motions, either extreme or subtle, such as arm-flapping, freezing, rocking back and forth or walking on their toes may also occur. Often, people with autism demand consistency in their environment. A minor change in routine may be tremendously upsetting.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sensory Difficulties - In children with autism, the brain seems unable to balance the senses appropriately. Many autistic children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes or smells. Some seem oblivious to cold or pain, but react hysterically to things that wouldn't bother other children. In some people, the senses are even scrambled. For example, touching a certain texture may induce a gagging response.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unusual Abilities - In rare cases, some children with ASDs display remarkable abilities, such as drawing detailed, realistic pictures at a young age or playing an instrument without training. Some can memorize difficult lists of items, such as statistics or names (this is called islets of intelligence or savant skills).</p>

                Children with PDDNOS demonstrate symptoms similar to autistic disorder, 
                but do not meet all criteria for the disorder. Children with CDD, which affects more boys than girls, 
                develop normally until approximately the first two years of life (average onset of symptoms is between 3 and 4 years) 
                but they then regress in most areas and continue worsening. Specifically, they experience a pronounced loss in motor, 
                language, social and intellectual skills. They also lose bowel and bladder control. Seizures may even occur.

                Ways to avoid a meltdown.

              <div class="faq-body">
                To avoid meltdowns, autistic children and teenagers need support to learn:
                <br>
                    what situations they find difficult?
                    <br>
                    what being overwhelmed feels like?
                    <br>
                    what to do in these situations?
                    <br>
                    The ideas below might help your autistic child avoid meltdowns.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Identify difficult situations:
                    <br>
                    This is about your child knowing what situations lead to them feeling overwhelmed and moving into meltdown.
                    <br>
                    You and your child could make or draw a list of difficult situations. These might be things like a different route to school, sudden loud noises like announcements on the train, or noise and jostling in changing rooms.
                    <br>
                    Meltdowns can also be triggered by a build-up of many small but distressing events. You could keep a diary to record what happens before meltdowns and look for patterns.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Notice early warning signs:
                    <br>
                    This is about helping your child to recognise signs that they’re feeling uncomfortable or that a meltdown might be coming. For example, you and your child could practise recognising emotions like anxiety. Or you could help your child describe how their body feels before a meltdown – for example, racing heartbeat, churning stomach or difficulty breathing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Develop coping strategies:
                    <br>
                    This is about your child knowing what helps them feel comfortable and calm in difficult situations. 
                    <br>
                    Options for coping in difficult situations might include:
                    <br>
                    breathing exercises, muscle relaxation techniques or simple things like taking a break and listening to music
                    practical actions like leaving classes a few minutes early to avoid noisy, crowded corridors
                    sensory aids like headphones to deal with triggering noises or favourite fragrances to deal with triggering smells.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Practise coping strategies:
                    <br>
                    Encourage your child to practise their coping strategies when they’re feeling calm. This will make it easier for your child to remember and use the strategies when they’re feel stressed or overwhelmed.
                    <br>
                    For example, you could make daily breathing exercises part of your child’s routine, or your child could practise using headphones when it gets noisy at home. Or you and your child could talk to their teachers about your child regularly leaving class 5 minutes early.

                How to improve communication and interaction with your child?

                <span class="faq-plus">&plus;</span>
              </h4>
              <div class="faq-body">
                There are no hard-and-fast rules on how to communicate with a child with ASD. But many family members have had success with these tips:
                <br>
                Be patient. It often takes a child with ASD longer to process information. You may need to slow down your conversation to his or her speed.
                <br>
                Teach the child how to express anger without being too aggressive. Children with ASD should know that they don't have to hold their anger and frustration inside.
                <br>
                Be persistent but resilient. Don't let your feelings get hurt if the child does not respond to you as you'd like. Children with ASD may have trouble both showing and controlling their emotions. They can be blunt in their responses. Don't take this personally.
                <br>
                Always stay positive. Children with ASD respond best to positive reinforcement. Be sure to talk about or reward good behavior often.
                <br>
                Ignore irritating attention-getting behavior. A child with ASD may act badly at times to get you to focus on them. Ignoring this behavior is often the best way to prevent it. Also talk about and reward the child's good behavior often.
                <br>
                Interact through physical activity. Children with ASD tend to have short attention spans. This is especially true when it comes to communicating. Running around and playing outside may be a better way of sharing time together. It will also let them relax and feel calmer.
                <br>
                Be affectionate and respectful. Children with ASD often need a hug, just like other children. Sometimes they need this much more than other children. But some children don't like to be touched. Respect their personal space. Never force physical affection on an unwilling child.
                <br>
                Show your love and interest. Children with ASD may have trouble showing their feelings. But they still need to know that you love them. Go out of your way to express your interest, caring, and support.
                <br>
                Believe. A child with autism is first and foremost a child. He or she is a growing person with unknown possibilities. Believe in what the child can do. Don’t define the child by a diagnosis.  
                <br>
                Take care of yourself. It’s OK to take a break. Join parent support groups. Or ask understanding family and friends to care for your child so you can recharge. School psychologists and counselors can also provide resources to help you.
